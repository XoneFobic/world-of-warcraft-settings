# Profiles

- [Blizzard UI](./profiles/blizzard-ui.md)
- [Details](./profiles/details.md)
- [ElvUI](./profiles/elvui.md)

# Layout requirements

- Set you blizzard UI scaling to 65% (Options > Graphics > Use UI Scale > `As low as it goes`)

# Layout considerations

- _None that I know of_

# Keybinds

My own goal with my keybind setup is that I use the same keys for the same type of spells across classes and specs.  
The only exception is usually healing, as there I switch the attack buttons and the healing buttons with each other.  
However, if you use healbot or something similar, you might not need to, as most interactions are not keybound at that point.

**Be aware that I main tanks, but it should be easy enough to convert stuff over to healing or DPS mains.**

_At the time of writing I use a Razer Naga Pro, the software to bind keys is somewhat limited in its settings. So they might appear a bit odd. Replace with what you have access to in your software._

# Macros (Not character / Class specific)

## General purpose

### Dismount
Mostly used for Dragon riding dismounts, as it switches your action bar.  
I put this on the last button on the bar that switches, which is MMO Button 9 on my mouse.
```lua
#show
/dismount
```

## Combat
Too lazy to switch out the buttons on the action bars when I switch trinkets

### Trinket 1
```lua
#showtooltip
/use 13
```

### Trinket 2
```lua
#showtooltip
/use 14
```

### Extra Action Button
This is the button that randomly pops up during fights
```lua
/click ExtraActionButton1
```
